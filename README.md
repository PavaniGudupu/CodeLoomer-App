# CodeLoomer-App

Welcome to your Expo app 👋  
This is an Expo project created with `create-expo-app`.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:
- Development build
- Android emulator
- iOS simulator
- Expo Go (a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo)

You can start developing by editing the files inside the `app` directory. This project uses file-based routing.

### Fresh Project Setup

When you're ready, run:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This command will:
- Move the starter code to the `app-example` directory
- Create a blank `app` directory where you can start developing
